IMPORTANT: The image filename must match the code EXACTLY.

The primary filename looked for is: Dr. Sayali.jpg
(Note the space after 'Dr.' and the capital 'S' and capital 'D')

If that doesn't work, ensure there are no hidden file extensions (like Dr. Sayali.jpg.jpg) and that the folder 'assets' is at the same level as your index.html file.
